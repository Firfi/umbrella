### Distance metrics

The package provides the
[`IDistance`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/distance/interfaces/IDistance.html)
interface for custom distance metric implementations & conversions from/to raw
distance values. The following preset metrics are provided too:

### Neighborhoods

Neighborhoods can be used to select n-D spatial items around a given target
location and an optional catchment radius (infinite by default). Neighborhoods
also use one of the given distance metrics and implement the widely used
[`IDeref`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/api/src/deref.ts)
interface to obtain the final query results.

Custom neighborhood selections can be defined via the
[`INeighborhood`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/distance/interfaces/INeighborhood.html)
interface. Currently, there are two different implementations available, each
providing several factory functions to instantiate and provide defaults for
different dimensions. See documentation and examples below.

#### Nearest

An `INeighborhood` implementation for nearest neighbor queries around a given
target location, initial query radius and `IDistance` metric to determine
proximity.

#### KNearest

An `INeighborhood` implementation for K-nearest neighbor queries around a given
target location, initial query radius and `IDistance` metric to determine
proximity. The K-nearest neighbors will be accumulated via an internal
[heap](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/heaps) and
results can be optionally returned in order of proximity (via `.deref()` or
`.values()`). For K=1 it will be more efficient to use `Nearest` to avoid the
additional overhead.

#### Radial

An unbounded and unsorted version of [`KNearest`](#knearest), selecting _all_
items around the target location and given search radius. Qualifying neighbors
will be accumulated in order of processing via an internal array.

{{meta.status}}

Work is underway integrating this approach into the spatial indexing data
structures provided by the
[@thi.ng/geom-accel](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/geom-accel)
package.

```ts

// collect the 3 nearest numbers for target=10 and using
// infinite selection radius and squared distance metric (defaults)
const k = d.knearestN(10, 3);
// consider each item for inclusion
Object.entries(items).forEach(([id, x]) => k.consider(x, id));

// retrieve result tuples of [distance, value]
k.deref()
// [ [ 25, 'a' ], [ 4, 'e' ], [ 0.25, 'c' ] ]

// result values only
k.values()
// [ 'a', 'e', 'c' ]

// neighborhood around 10, K=3 w/ max radius 5
// also use Eucledian distance and sort results by proximity
const k2 = d.knearestN(10, 3, 5, d.EUCLEDIAN1, true);
Object.entries(items).forEach(([id, x]) => k2.consider(x, id));

k2.deref()
// [ [ 0.5, 'c' ], [ 2, 'e' ], [ 5, 'a' ] ]
